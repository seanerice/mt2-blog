My project updates will live here.

## Week of 1.13.2020
I want to pick up where I left off in MTI -- build an interactive piece using pose tracking and classification. This will likely involve building a custom RNN along with creating lots of _good_ training data.

### Progress
- Create GitHub page @ [seanerice.github.io/mt2-blog/](GitHub page)

### What's slowing me down
- Sickness :(

### For next week
- Research ML packages suitable for LSTM
- Ask how to get lab time in MoCap lab
